# 2021Wanxiang-Blockchain-Hackathon-AmaraLink

AmaraLink is a data cross-chain bridge of multisignature threshold technology, striving to become an crypto data conversion hub connecting Polkadot and other public chains. 
At the current stage, we are developing a bridge to connect Moonriver and Polygon/Ethereum. We hope to conduct a demonstration in October to further improve it. 
It will be officially open to all users after the audit.
